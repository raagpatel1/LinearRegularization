# LinearRegularization

Using data sourced from superconductivity research, we have 167 features, with 21,263 entries, that we will use to train models to predict the critical temperature of superconductors. There are a wide range of features, ranging from different measures of atomic mass, first ionization energy (FIE), density, electron affinity, fusion heat, thermal conductivity, and valence. There are also the elemental compounds listed, with the weights of each element for 15,542 unique materials. Though there are multiple similar elemental compounds, evident by having less unique materials than the total entries, there are no duplicates in the data.
Since we are focusing on using linear models to represent the critical temperature, we need to check the distribution of the response. The Anderson-Darling test is a statistical method used to evaluate the normality of a dataset. It assesses the hypothesis that a given sample follows a normal distribution, which is an essential assumption in linear regression. The test yields a statistic known as the Anderson-Darling statistic, which quantifies the degree of deviation from normality. Lower values of this statistic indicate closer adherence to the normal distribution, while higher values suggest significant deviations.
